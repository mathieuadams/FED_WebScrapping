# FED_WebScrapping
This Python script scrapes press release articles from the [Federal Reserve's official press release page](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm) using Selenium. It extracts the title, description, and release date of each article and saves the data into a CSV file.
